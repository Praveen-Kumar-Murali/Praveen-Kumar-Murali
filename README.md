<!-- ========================= ABOUT ME ========================= -->

## 🧠 About Me

I am a Robotics Engineer specializing in **ROS2-based autonomous systems**, currently pursuing the **Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Intelligent Field Robotic Systems (IFRoS)**.

My work focuses on **autonomy, perception, and deployment-ready robotics systems** — going beyond simulations into real-world execution.

I have engineered **AGVs and AMRs**, integrating **LIDAR perception, Navigation Stack 2, and AI-driven decision pipelines** for dynamic environments.

I bring a **systems-level mindset**, combining **embedded control, robotics architecture, and AI integration** into cohesive, scalable solutions.

With experience across **industrial robotics (YASAKAWA, FANUC)**, I understand both **research depth and production constraints**.

I have also led **20+ innovation projects** and delivered robotics education to **2000+ learners**, translating complex systems into actionable engineering.


Currently pursuing the **Erasmus Mundus Master’s in Intelligent Field Robotic Systems (IFRoS)**, focused on developing globally deployable autonomous systems.
